# Python Helix Demo

This repo is to showcase how to set things up for Python web development in the [Helix editor](https://helix-editor.com/). It will allow me to create a new project that can properly handle linting and LSP of Python and JavaScript. Other items, such as CSS, Docker, HTML, and YAML are handled outside of this based on the [default Helix language servers](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/How-to-install-the-default-language-servers).

This all operates in conjunction with my [Helix base config](https://gist.github.com/jfabry-noc/4c5f28d9eccf5bd21094cad2aebeedd2) and [Helix language config](https://gist.github.com/jfabry-noc/b57e657528e46a34c48a9ab749290307).
